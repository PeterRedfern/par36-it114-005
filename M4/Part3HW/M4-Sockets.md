<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>1. Message shuffler (randomizes the order of the characters of the given message).<br>Command should be shuffle or randomize (clearly mention what you chose). The message<br>should be sent to all clients showing it's from the user but randomized.<br>Example: Bob types command hello and everyone receives Bob: lleho.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Using a flag,<br>the message is determined to be shuffled or not. Once the shuffle command<br>is given it makes shuffled true. It creates an arraylist to hold the<br>string that will be shuffled. Then iterates through the letters in the string<br>and adds them to a charArray which then goes into Collections.shuffle and gets<br>the letters shuffled around. A stringBuilder then puts the shuffled letters together and<br>assigns the shuffle to the message to be printed out at the end<br>of the process.&nbsp;</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>An ignore case is made for shuffle which actives the command statement when<br>the user types shuffle. From there a series of arrays is made to<br>carry the characters from the user&#39;s input to be shuffled. After they are<br>shuffled, it gets assigned back to the original message and it is then<br>printed. <br></p>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Did you have an issues and how did you resolve them? If no issues, what did you learn during this assignment that you found interesting?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Learning to work with flags and nesting loops inside of other loops to<br>get the problem work was interesting. My code for the scrambler didn&#39;t work<br>at first because of the fact that there was no flag, after I<br>added the flag and nested my other statements inside, the code worked. This<br>also helped me see the importance of the scope of the different variables<br>and their place in making the problem run.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
