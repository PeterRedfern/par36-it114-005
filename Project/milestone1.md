<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <ol><br><li>The server connection is started and it then creates the main lobby<br>while listening for clients to join. There are options to create more rooms<br>and do commands. The interactions between the client and the server are handled<br>by ServerThread.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>2. The client checks if the user is connected then takes in<br>an input (the connection command) from there you have to input your name<br>and then once you are connected, it focuses on processing commands and checking<br>for more inputs. The overall interactions and transfers of these Payloads are managed<br>by the ServerThread which connects the client and the server.</div><div><br></div><div>3. The sockets open<br>up a connection in the Server which is for clients to connect to.<br>Once the client seeks to connect to the server with the /connect command,<br>the socket creates a thread for the client and the client is then<br>connected through a process from ServerThread which takes the commands from Server and<br>Client and lets them interface with one another to form the connection. From<br>there the client is connected to the server and the client can then<br>send messages/commands in the server.&nbsp;</div><br></li><br></ol><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>The server was terminated using ctrl + c. This printed out Socket Exceptions<br>and the messages &quot;Server closed connection&quot; among others.

</td></tr>
</table></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how the various disconnects/terminations are handled</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>1. The client uses the disconnect command which then has ServerThread remove them<br>from the thread/socket which then terminates their connection to the server.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>2. The client<br>program has a boolean to detect if it is connected or not and<br>thus deal with a disconnect accordingly. If it is not connected, then it<br>will revert to it's initial functions like when it started up and tell<br>the user it is not connected to a server.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>3. The server doesn't crash<br>when a user leaves because the ServerThread is programmed with an exception to<br>handle a client not being connected. From there, the server continues it's own<br>processing after printing out the exception.&nbsp;</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Talk about any issues or learnings during this assignment</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Jumping from using part 3 to part 5 was a bit of a<br>change. In part 3 we used Strings but here it is changed to<br>payloads which also adds some other nice features. I like the slash commands<br>because it makes it easier to specify whether you want to type a<br>command or not. The debug and extra messages in the server/client side is<br>neat and helpful but I hope we will learn soon about how to<br>put them in a text message so clutter will be reduced. I had<br>some issues at first connecting and getting used to the slash commands but<br>over time, I figured it out and got everything working how it was<br>supposed to.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
